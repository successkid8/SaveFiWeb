      question: 'How does SaveFi work?',
      answer: 'SaveFi automatically saves a percentage of your trades into a time-locked vault. You can set your preferred savings rate, and the platform will handle the rest. Your savings are secured in a vault that unlocks after a set period.'
    },
    {
      question: 'What is the minimum lock period?',
      answer: 'Currently, the minimum lock period is 1 month. We plan to introduce more flexible options in the future.'
    },
    {
      question: 'How are rewards calculated?',
      answer: 'Rewards are calculated based on your total savings amount and the duration of your vault lock. The longer you keep your savings locked, the higher your rewards will be.'
    },
    {
      question: 'Can I withdraw my savings early?',
      answer: 'No, savings in the vault cannot be withdrawn before the lock period ends. This is to ensure the security of your funds and maintain the integrity of the platform.'
    },
    {
      question: 'What happens if I miss a trade?',
      answer: 'No worries! SaveFi only saves when you trade. If you don\'t trade, no savings are deducted. You can continue trading normally whenever you want.'
    },
    {
      question: 'How do I get started?',
      answer: 'Simply connect your Solana wallet, set your preferred savings rate, and start trading. SaveFi will automatically handle the rest.'
    }
